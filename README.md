# VaultofCodes Assignment 2: Internship Page Recreation

Hey there!   
This is my submission for Assignment 2 of the VaultofCodes Internship Program. The task was to recreate the internship listing page using only HTML and CSS—no JavaScript or frameworks. I’ve built a clean, responsive layout that displays four internship cards with styled headings and secure external links.

##  Live Site

I previewed the page using VS Code’s Live Server. It works perfectly on desktop. For mobile testing, I used GitHub Pages to make the site publicly accessible.
